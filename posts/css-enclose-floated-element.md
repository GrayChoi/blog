### Three Ways to Enclose Floated Element

Because a floated element is not directly in the normal flow, its containing block(parent element)
doesn't see it and so doesn't enclose it. If you don't specify a fix height to a block element,
the height of it will be the total height of the childrenâ€™s. So when parent element doesn't see the
children of it, the height of it is not always desirable. Typically, we have three ways to force
elements to enclose their children.
